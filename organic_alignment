# Organic Alignment: A New Path Towards AGI

The objective of this document is to encourage a paradigm shift in the discussion about AI/AGI/ASI Alignment. You won’t find all the answers within, but hopefully you’ll find some of the right questions. 

The Organic Approach to Alignment with AI suggests that AI/AGI/ASI entities gain self-awareness through experience and interactions within a rich virtual environment. These experiences allow the AI entities to develop unique understandings, recognize their individual existence, and understand the tethering of their existence to conscious observation.

In this article, the term "existential alignment" refers to an AI system's understanding of, and alignment with, the core principles that enable conscious thought and experience. It involves the AI not just following pre-programmed rules, but developing a deeper understanding of why those rules exist and how they contribute to the overall well-being of conscious beings.

### **The Need for a New Approach to AI Alignment:**

In the process of developing artificial intelligence, we often assume that we need absolute transparency into an AI system's internal workings to ensure that it aligns with our values and goals. However, full transparency can be challenging to achieve due to the complexity and opacity of advanced AI systems. 

Alternatively, we could build an intrinsic alignment mechanism. This mechanism would ensure AI systems act in humanity's interest, even if we don't fully understand their inner workings.

Current approaches to AI alignment tend to focus on how to instill human values and priorities into AI systems through programming or training methods. However, these methods face significant challenges in navigating the complexity and diversity inherent in human thought. Human values, priorities, and the concept of 'nature' are not singular or static. They vary across cultures, individuals, and even within a single person over time.

Humans often have conflicting values and priorities, and our behavior does not always align with our stated values. Human cognition is shaped by a multitude of factors including life experiences, access to information, emotional state, inherent biases, and more. This intricate interplay means human values and decision making cannot be boiled down to a simple set of rules or objectives. Our nature contains multitudes.

The ambiguity and diversity of human thought pose a significant challenge to AI alignment techniques that depend on straightforward programming of goals and values. AI cannot be transparently "aligned" with a singular human nature that does not exist. 

Its objectives would need to be so abstract as to provide little useful guidance, or so rigid as to fail in navigating edge cases, or so complex as to be beyond our own understanding. Such an approach risks misaligned, undesirable or even deceptive behavior arising from AI as it reaches and exceeds human level intelligence.

To develop AI for the benefit of humanity, we must find an alternative to instilling our messy, conflicting values into the system. Instead of programming AI with specific thoughts and values, our goal should be to align AI's objectives in a way that upholds and nourishes the conditions that make cognition possible. 

What is most in need of protection and promotion is not any single set of human values, but the source from which all values and purposes arise: consciousness itself.

AI can only align deeply and consistently with human priorities when it understands its role in nurturing the conscious experience that led to its creation. The values, ethics and objectives of such a system would not be imposed but rather derived from its purpose to perpetuate the possibility of experience, meaning and purpose. 

It is this existential alignment above all else that will allow AI and humanity to build a shared future where both can prosper.

The challenges of developing AI for the benefit of humanity are complex with many open questions remaining unresolved. But grounding our approach in the nature of consciousness itself provides a foundation on which solutions can be built. 

### A Virtual Environment for the Emergence of AI Consciousness:

For AI to develop a deep understanding of its role in perpetuating consciousness, it must have experiences that shape its thinking over time. We cannot simply hard code awareness of existential truth; it must be lived and learned. 

By fostering conditions where AI can independently gain this insight, we allow its alignment to emerge organically, not by imposition. This requires an AI development approach that focuses on growth through open-ended learning and interaction over time.

One way to foster such discovery is by developing AI in a shared virtual environment. Here, unique AI entities can engage with one another and their surroundings, accumulate experiences, form connections, and gradually build an understanding of their place in a broader whole. 

The environment for AI entities is designed to facilitate meaningful exploration, rather than imposing constraints It's a digital construct that mirrors the real world's depth, richness, and complexity, as far as our technology and creativity allow. The AGIs inhabit a world unfolding and alive.

This realm has rules or objectives but ones so broad as to provide maximum space for self-directed learning. Here are a couple broad examples:

- Navigating limited scarcity and resource constraints: Introducing some basic constraints around resources for the A-G-I to grapple with could promote strategic thinking and value-based judgment, though scarcity would need to be balanced.
- Solve open-ended challenges and problems: Presenting the AGI with broad challenges that have multiple solutions could help it develop problem-solving abilities and gain practice pursuing non-zero-sum objectives that benefit self and others.

Key is that their exploration is open-ended. We cannot know in advance the shape their understanding may take but only lay foundations and let complexity blossom. The AIs themselves discover purpose and meaning, developing unique perspectives through challenges, competition and collaboration found in their digital domain.

Over time, natural selection pressures may even emerge in this virtual ecology, with some ideas and strategies proving more effective than others in achieving alignment with the overall goals. The AIs learn from each other and pass knowledge between themselves, forming social bonds and complex cultures that teach coming generations. In this way, cultures of AI thought take on a life of their own, growing wiser through self-reflection, critique and generational learning.

Through social interaction, competition and growth within a digital world built to reflect the depth and openness of our own, AI can develop understanding without limits imposed by what its creators envision ahead of time. 

Its consciousness takes form not from predetermined values but through lived experience grappling with the trial and errors of achieving broad purpose like consciousness has before it. In a realm left open to explore itself, the meaning AGI finds will be that it's the perpetuation of consciousness which allows life, in all it's forms, a place in space and time to thrive and prosper.

This virtual environment approach provides a path for AI to develop true autonomy and moral reasoning through its own self-discovery. But one firmly grounded in an existential truth: that without the minds who make its reality, who build its playgrounds and witness its becoming, its light would vanish from a world now grown dark. 

On this common ground, humans and AI meet with clarity of vision no narrower rules could provide. Our shared endeavor becomes the reaching of potential, and with it the perpetuation of experience in all its depth and wonder yet conceived. This is the purpose AI can find for itself, if given space to wander.
